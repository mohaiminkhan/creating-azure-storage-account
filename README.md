# creating-azure-storage-account
This JSON file is the source code of a storage account creation process in the Azure Sandbox for a fictitious surf web app company. The aim of this project was that the surf report site would let users upload photos and videos of local beach conditions. Viewers would use the content to help them choose the beach with the best surfing conditions.

My list of design and feature goal was- 

Video content must load quickly.

The site must handle unexpected spikes in upload volume.

Outdated content must be removed as surf conditions change so the site always shows current conditions.
